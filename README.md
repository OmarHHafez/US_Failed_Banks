## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and visualize bank failures in the United States from the year 2001 to 2023. Data is provided by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The dashboard focuses on revealing patterns and trends in bank failures, comparing the 2008 economic crash to the year 2023, and highlighting the largest failed banks based on their assets.

## Results
